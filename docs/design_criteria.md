# Design Criteria (Draft)

Author: Henry Fuss

List each criterion with how you'll measure it and why it matters to the context.

1. **Findability (Venue)**  
   - *Measure:* Time-to-first-play and time-to-availability view in a hallway test.  
   - *Why:* Venue owners often browse under time pressure.

2. **Booking Error Prevention**  
   - *Measure:* % of test users who attempt double-booking or submit missing details.  
   - *Why:* Reduces admin overhead and friction.

3. **Mobile Usability**  
   - *Measure:* SUS score on mobile; tap targets â‰¥ 44px; no horizontal scroll.  
   - *Why:* DJs and venues use phones on the go.

4. **Accessibility**  
   - *Measure:* Colour contrast passes; keyboard navigation; alt text coverage.  
   - *Why:* Inclusive design + assessment requirements.

5. **Learnability (DJ Dashboard)**  
   - *Measure:* Tasks completed without guidance on first try.  
   - *Why:* DJs should publish a profile quickly.
